btrfs-heatmap v9, Oct 14, 2020
  * Support image output to stdout! This is an awesome feature, because
    we can pipe the output into a tool like catimg to show pictures in a
    text based terminal instead of having to copy png files around!
  * Rename heatmap.py to btrfs-heatmap. It should be shipped like that
    in the distro packaging, and it makes documentation etc. more
    straightforward.
  * Move the manual page from the debian branch into the normal source
    tree.
  * Allow setting colors for specific bg flags. In order to use this
    feature, it's still necessary to edit the dev_extent_colors
    dictionary in the program code. There's no command line option or
    anything. But, at least it can be done.
  * Fixes:
    - Actually use the python-btrfs FileSystem object context manager.
    - Default to white color for unknown tree number. This prevents the
      program from crashing when a yet unknown metadata tree number is
      encountered.
  * Various small documentation and bug fixes.

btrfs-heatmap v8, Jan 19, 2019
  * This program now needs at least python-btrfs v10
  * Make sorting on virtual address actually produce correct output
    for RAID0, RAID10, RAID5 and RAID6.
  * Change license to MIT (Expat)
